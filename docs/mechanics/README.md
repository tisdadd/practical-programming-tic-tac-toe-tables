How this game works. Here we answer the following questions, and add in more detail as needed.

- What rules make up Tic-Tac-Toe?
- What is the core loop of the game?
  - How do we start that loop?
  - What makes that loop end?

## Folder and File List

- [core-loop.md](core-loop.md) - The main loop of the game.
- [rules.md](rules.md) - The rules of this game.

## Summary of Usage

The answers at the start of this document are answered through the files linked. To use this, we should look at the [core-loop](core-loop.md) and the [rules](rules.md) in tandem, starting with the conditions to start and end the loop, and finally creating the loop itself.

### Answer the following, and implement as needed

- Should we have a computer opponent, or human only?
  - How would we implement a computer opponent?

    - How could this be implemented?
- ~~What should the final display look like?~~
- ~~What should be refactored (the code changed to be more readable or efficient)?~~
