# docs Folder

This folder contains the documentation for this project. We keep our thought processes for the project here, as well as any design documents and diagrams. They may be linked to inside of the main project files as needed.

## Folder and File List

- [diagrams/](diagrams/README.md) - A place for the diagrams to live.
- [mechanics/](mechanics/README.md) - Descriptions of the mechanics for this game - in other words, how is it meant to work.
